# Gota's Sequence Library

A platform-agnostic library for interpreting and playing sequence data for NintendoWare sequences. The bulk of the
player code was made by Kermalis.

## Dependencies

Note, this library depends on my Sound/IO library which you can find here: https://github.com/Gota7/GotaSoundIO
